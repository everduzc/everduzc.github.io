			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p> I am a First Generation UC Berkeley graduate from the border cities of Calexico,CA and Mexicali, BC. I studied Data Science at UC Berkeley and I am currently working for a marketing company as a Data Science Intern. I am interested in pursuing a career as a Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Machine Learning Engineer, or Data Engineer,  and I am open to any new opportunities. In my free time I like to play chess, work out, and watch sports.
That's it. Thank you for reading. </p>
