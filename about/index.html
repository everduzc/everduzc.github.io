			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p> I am a First Generation UC Berkeley graduate from the border cities of Calexico,CA and Mexicali, BC. I studied Data Science at UC Berkeley and I am currently pursuing a Masters in CS-Machine Learning at Georgia Tech. I am interested in pursuing a career as a Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, Data Engineer, and Software Developer. In my free time I like to play chess, work out, and watch sports (Go Yankees!).
That's it. Thank you for time and attention. </p>
